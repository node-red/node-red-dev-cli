# Similar Names

## Requirements
The package should use a unique name.
The tool will check for packages of the same name with a different scope and these may be highlighted to the user.

## Reason
Pacakges should use unique names, where a package is abandoned and another developer updates it and publishes a fork under their own scope this will help users to identify that they are similar pacakges, the README should me clear where a package is a fork and what the changes are.
